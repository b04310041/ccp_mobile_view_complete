                <p>Vietnam is a Southeast Asian country known for its beaches, rivers, Buddhist pagodas and bustling cities.</p>
                <p>Hanoi, the capital, pays homage to the nation’s iconic Communist-era leader, Ho Chi Minh, via a huge marble mausoleum. Ho Chi Minh City (formerly Saigon) has French colonial landmarks, plus Vietnamese War history museums and the Củ Chi tunnels, used by Viet Cong soldiers.<a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam">Vietnam</a>.</p>

                <h2>The Old Kingdom</h2>
                <p>Hoi An’s utterly charming Ancient Town is one of Vietnam’s top attractions, but despite the crowds, still hasn’t lost its beguiling charm. Centrally located in Hoi An town, alongside picturesque Thu Bon River, this compact enclave was once a thriving Silk Road trading port, from the 16th to 19th centuries.</p>
